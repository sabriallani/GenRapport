    "- **Risk Level": "** High",
    "- **Description": "** The Radiocomm data link dual frequency interface exhibits susceptibility to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. An attacker is able to set up a rogue access point and mimic the drone's 2.4 GHz or 5 GHz network. This vulnerability allows for Advanced Resolution Protocol (ARP) spoofing, leading to the potential interception and manipulation of sensitive video/control data despite the AES encryption process initially in place.",
    "- **Risks": "** This vulnerability allows for hostile actors to infiltrate the system, intercept and potentially manipulate the drone's control or video data. The attacker could gain control over the drone, resulting in serious security and operational risks.",
    "- **Complexity": "** Low. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would only need the standard equipment generally used for wifi attacks and the proficient understanding of the drone's network.",
    "- **Priority": "** High. Due to the potential severe impact on the system's integrity, this vulnerability must be addressed urgently.",

    "- Description": "The drone system is found to be highly vulnerable to flood attacks leading to high packet loss. Malformed packets, when flooded onto the data link, disrupt video feed's integrity and interfere with the control signals. This results in the drone becoming unresponsive or unstable.",
    "- Risks": "The risks involve severe disruption in the video feed and control signals, leading to complete drone unresponsiveness or instability. Critical information may be lost or misinterpreted due to these interruptions. There's also a potential risk of malicious command injection under this vulnerability.",

    "- CVSS": "7.5 (High)",
    "- Risk level": "High",
    "- Description": "The wireless network observed is vulnerable to Man in the Middle (MITM) attacks through the creation of a rogue access point utilizing a Pineapple device. The attack took advantage of a security shortcoming within the network's HTTPS that allowed it to be downgraded, culminating in successful unauthorized access to the drone's network. Additionally, AES encryption proved ineffective as a preventative measure against data exposure.",
    "- Risks": "The risks associated with these vulnerabilities include unauthorized network access, potential theft or compromise of sensitive data, disruption of network and device functionality, and a breach of confidentiality, integrity, and availability principles.",
    "- Complexity": "Medium. The complexity of exploiting this vulnerability is relatively medium, requiring knowledge of MITM attacks, the ability to create a rogue WiFi AP using a Pineapple WiFi device and use tools like sslstrip effectively. However, the successful handshake capture and successful WiFi password crack using a wordlist under 10M attempts shows the defender's security measures were not sufficient.",
    "- Priority": "High. Given the successful breach and the potential damage to privacy and security, the remediation of such vulnerabilities should be considered high priority.",
